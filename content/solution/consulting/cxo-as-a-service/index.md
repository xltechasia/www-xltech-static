As your CIOaaS, XLTech provides senior management engagement on IT effectiveness, costs and strategic alignment, without the overhead from hiring a senior manager in a critical but non-core role.

We work your staff to ensure IT skills, planning and delivery are thinking long-term and sustainability, and not floundering on fundamentals that distract value creation.

CTOaaS is designed for start-ups and business projects that require a CTO during the formative design and development stages of technical solutions.

As your CTOaaS, XLTech can help you define, resolve and document your projectâ€™s architecture, design principles, integration solutions, interface specifications, API, technology stacks, data models and solution selection.
