[^1]: XLCloud Supra Series utilize direct attached storage. Space is fixed, with upgrades to the next model (SKU) the only storage expansion path.
[^2]: XLRestore is designed primarily as a disaster recovery solution. A copy of the server and storage contents are encrypted and sent to an overseas storage service at the end of every day. These backups are kept for 30 days before being destroyed.
