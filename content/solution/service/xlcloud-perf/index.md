The Performa Series are focused on performance with ease of growth as your storage needs grow.

The Performa series is ideal for storing dynamic data, with room to grow for high storage need scenarios.

All Performa series have a prescribed data storage capacity, with the option to grow the space you need in 100GB increments. So you know exactly what your investment is each month.

## XLCloud Performa Tier 1

Tier 1 systems are great prototyping, staging, testing or ad-hoc usage solutions. There are 3 basic configurations that let you start small as grow your implementation and understand your storage and capacity needs.

Great for home, SOHO, teams of up to 20 regular users (BT1/25GP), or for distributing files for read-only access by external parties.

[^1]: XLCloud Performa Series utilizes Block Storage.
[^2]: XLRestore is designed primarily as a disaster recovery solution. A copy of the server and storage contents are encrypted and sent to an overseas storage service at the end of every day. These backups are kept for 30 days before being destroyed.
[^3]: If the base system has a XLRestore subscription, then all additional storage units consumed will automatically include a XLTRestore subscription.
[^4]: As general guidance, increased memory will improve overall system performance in typical usage scenarios.
