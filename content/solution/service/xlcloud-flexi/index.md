The XLCloud Flexi Series are focused on providing safe, secure cloud storage capacity at the most economical cost point viable.

The Flexi series is ideal for storing large amounts of data, media files, and backups.

All Flexi series automatically adjust their storage usage based on your usage patterns - any overage is charged on a monthly average - not peak consumed - in 250GB increments. This means no nasty bill shock or permanent commitments to storage you do not need everyday.

XLCoud Flexi is offered in three tiers to help ensure you have the optimal solution available to your needs.

## XLCloud Flexi Tier 1

Tier 1 systems are great prototyping, staging, testing or ad-hoc usage solutions. There are 3 basic configurations that let you start small as grow your implementation and understand your storage and capacity needs.

Great for home, SOHO, teams of up to 20 regular users (OT1/25GP), or for distributing files for read-only access by external parties.

### XLCloud Flexi Tier 1 Features

- Change to any other configuration on request within the Tier
- Tier 1 systems can be upgraded to Tier 2 at any time
- All Flexi Tier 1 systems include 500GB of storage prepaid

## XLCloud Flexi Tier 3

Tier 3 systems feature dedicated CPUs for improved servier side processing power.

These server are suitable when workloads involve more sophisitacated or central processing intensive extensions to the servers functionality through plug-ins.

_Notes:_

[^1]: XLCloud Flexi Series utilize Object Storage. Due to encoding and storage requirements, additional overhead is carried, therefore actual storage usage reported by Nextcloud will be 30% to 50% lower than the space consumed. As guidance, each 150GB of file storage reported by Nextcloud, represents approximately 250GB of space on system storage.
[^2]: XLRestore is designed primarily as a diseaster recovery solution. A copy of the server and storage contents are encrypted and sent to an overseas storage service at the end of every day. These backups are kept for 30 days before being destroyed.
[^3]: If the base system has a XLRestore subscription, then all additional storage units consumped will automatically include a XLTRestore subscription.
[^4]: As general guidance, increased memory will improve overall system performance in typical usage scenarios, unless server-side based processing and functionality added.
