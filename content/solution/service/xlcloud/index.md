## Finding the Right Fit

We offer the different series for XLCloud so you can find the right fit for your needs - from low-cost storage through to high-performance storage for high-volume synchronization scenarios.

## [XLCloud Flexi Series](/solution/service/xlcloud-flexi/)

The Flexi Series are focused on storage capacity, with the aim of providing the most storage possible for the lowest cost, with ample speed for typical usage scenarios.

The Flexi series is ideal for storing large amounts of data that is primarily created and not frequently modified. Great as a private distribution platform for large format media such as video, high-definition graphics and publishing media.

All Flexi series automatically adjust their storage usage based on your usage patterns - any overage is charged on a month average - not peak consumed or total at the end of month - so no nasty bill shock or permanent commitments to storage you do not need everyday.
